# Tissue Purifier 
Tissue Purifier (TP) is a tool to perform tissue analysis in python.
Tissue are cropped into overlapping patches, semantic features are associated to each patch via self-supervised (contrastive) 
learning. The learned features are used in downstram tasks (such as differential gene expression analysis).
